# Thank you for your contribution

First, thank you for taking the time to help improving Cecilifier; I really appreciate it.

That being said, in order to help improving Cecilifier codebase quality please consider the following check list:

- [ ] I have performed a self-review of my own code
- [ ] I have commented my code, particularly in hard-to-understand areas
- [ ] I have added tests that prove my fix is effective or that my feature works
- [ ] My code is following the existing conventions. I understand that even the existing code some times does not follow the conventions but please, strive to follow whatever is the most common used convention used in the codebase.
- [ ] I have double checked that my code is not adding duplications
- [ ] Front-end (web site) related fixes/features were tested manually (as of today we don't have an automated test for that).
- [ ] I have made corresponding changes to the documentation (README.md, website, etc) ?
- [ ] I have verified that there is an issue open describing the actual problem/feature and have referenced it in the commit message that fixes/implement it.
